# Test Data

The included CSV files were originally exported from the BFF.fm tracking database of songs that have been played on BFF.fm over the past decade. Each data point is unique, and therefore does not contain play counts or other particularly useful information about the music played on the station (if you're interested in analysing BFF.fm data, please get in touch via https://developer.bff.fm.)

All data is manually crowdsourced from humans, ergo there are variations and errors. The purpose of Normcore is try and wrangle a reasonable % of those variants into reliable tags, such that tracking data can be more thoroughly aggregated.

The unit and integration tests were sourced from real data in these files. You can also run Normcore against these full batches of data to observe any shifts in generated data after changes.
